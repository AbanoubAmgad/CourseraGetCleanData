# CodeBook

This is Data Collected from the Original data we got from experiments which have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.

## Data contains 180 observations and 68 Variables

# Transformations 

* Added a Column Called "Type" to The Raw data to recognize if the data is "Train" or "Test" 
* Changed the Variables' names from V1,V2,.. to more descriptive names
* Merged both Train and Test Data
* disregarded other data than mean and std
* Changed Activity column to Activity Names
* melted the merged data to reshape it used Subject and Activity as ID
* casted the data to get the mean of each variable
* used write.table to output the tidy data set
